# State Estimation and Localization for Self-Driving Cars

## What you'll learn

- Understand the key methods for parameter and state estimation used for autonomous driving, such as the method of least-squares
- Develop a model for typical vehicle localization sensors, including GPS and IMUs
- Apply extended and unscented Kalman Filters to a vehicle state estimation problem
- Apply LIDAR scan matching and the Iterative Closest Point algorithm
