## Supplementary Reading: Pose Estimation from LIDAR Data

To learn more about Pose Estimation from LIDAR data, check out the resources below:

- Read Chapter 8, Section 1.3 of [Timothy D. Barfoot, State Estimation for Robotics (2016)](http://asrl.utias.utoronto.ca/~tdb/bib/barfoot_ser17.pdf) (available for free).
- Read the Wikipedia articles on [point set registration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_set_registration) and ICP.
- Examine a method to produce an [accurate closed-form estimate of  ICP's covariance](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4209579) from Andrea Censi of the University of Rome "La Sapienza" (now at ETH Zurich).
- Read a research paper on [LIDAR and Inertial Fusion for Pose Estimation by Non-linear Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.07104.pdf), available for free on arXiv.
- Review the original papers by [Yang Chen and Gerard Medioni (1991)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/132043), and [Paul Besl and Neil McKay (1992)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/121791), that first described (variations of the) iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm.
