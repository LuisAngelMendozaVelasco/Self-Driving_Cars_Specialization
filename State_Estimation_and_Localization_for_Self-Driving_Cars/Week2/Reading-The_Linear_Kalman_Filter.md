## Supplementary Reading: The Linear Kalman Filter

To learn more about the Linear Kalman Filter, check out the resources below: 

- Here's an interesting [blog post by Tim Babb explaining the Kalman filter](https://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/). Babb is the Lighting Optimization Lead for Pixar Animation Studios.
- You can find an extensive, detailed treatment of the Kalman filter in Chapter 3, Section 3 of [Timothy D. Barfoot, State Estimation for Robotics (2017)](http://asrl.utias.utoronto.ca/~tdb/bib/barfoot_ser17.pdf) (available for free).
- Read another detailed explanation in Chapter 5, Section 1 of [Dan Simon, Optimal State Estimation (2006)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/0470045345).
- Explore a variety of great resources related to the Kalman filter on [this page](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~welch/kalman/) maintained by Greg Welch from the University of Central Florida and Gary Bishop from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
- Read Kalman's [original article](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~welch/kalman/kalmanPaper.html) on the linear filter, courtesy of Welch and Bishop and hosted at UNC at Chapel Hill (available for free).
