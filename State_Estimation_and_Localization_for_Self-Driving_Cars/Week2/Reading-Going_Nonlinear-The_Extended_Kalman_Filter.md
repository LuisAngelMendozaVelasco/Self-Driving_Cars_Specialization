## Supplementary Reading: Going Nonlinear - The Extended Kalman Filter

To learn more about the nonlinear Kalman filtering and the extended Kalman filter, check out the resources below:

- To learn more about nonlinear Kalman filtering, check out [this article](https://www.embedded.com/design/connectivity/4025693/Using-nonlinear-Kalman-filtering-to-estimate-signals) by Dan Simon (available for free).
- A detailed explanation of linearization and how it relates to the EKF can be found in Chapter 13,  Sections 1 and 2 of [Dan Simon, Optimal State Estimation (2006)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/0470045345).
