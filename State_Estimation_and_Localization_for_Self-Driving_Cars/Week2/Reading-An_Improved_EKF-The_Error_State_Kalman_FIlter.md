## Lesson 4 Supplementary Reading: An Improved EKF - The Error State Kalman Filter

To learn more about the Error State Kalman Filter, check out the resources below:

- Review an important paper by Stergios Roumeliotis et al. on the use of the [error-state Kalman filter for mobile robot localization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/772597). This paper deals with the important case of aided localization, which in the topic of Module 5.
- Read Section 5 of a technical report by [Joan Sol√†, Quaternion kinematics for the error-state Kalman filter, 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02508.pdf) (available for free). Note that this is an advanced reading.
