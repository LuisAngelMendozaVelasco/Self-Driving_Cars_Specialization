## Supplementary Reading: Multisensor Fusion for State Estimation

To learn more about Multisensor fusion, check out the resources below:

- Read Sections 5.1-5.4 and Section 6.1 of a technical report by [Joan Sol√†, Quaternion kinematics for the error-state Kalman filter, 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02508.pdf) (available for free). Note that this is an advanced reading.
- Read a [research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896317323674/pdf?md5=2f94917729162909667073a66392087a&pid=1-s2.0-S2405896317323674-main.pdf) by Jay Farrell and Paul Roysdon that provides a tutorial for autonomous driving state estimation.
- Read a [Medium article](https://medium.com/@wilburdes/sensor-fusion-algorithms-for-autonomous-driving-part-1-the-kalman-filter-and-extended-kalman-a4eab8a833dd) about sensor fusion algorithms for autonomous driving (Kalman filters and extended Kalman filters).
- Review an [article](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608321/this-image-is-why-self-driving-cars-come-loaded-with-many-types-of-sensors/) from MIT Technology Review that explains the need for sensor fusion to enable robust autonomous driving.
