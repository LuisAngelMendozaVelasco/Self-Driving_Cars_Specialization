## Supplementary Reading: Least Squares and the Method of Maximum Likelihood

To learn more about Least Squares and Maximum Likelihood, check out the resources below:

- Explore this [interactive explanation](http://mfviz.com/central-limit/) of the Central Limit Theorem by Michael Freeman. 
- Read more about maximum likelihood on the [STAT 414/415](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat415/lesson/1/1.2) website from Penn State.
- If you are a history buff, you may wish to read this [article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.2996.pdf) describing the history of the method of maximum likelihood and its relationship to least squares. Originally printed in the journal Statistical Science and available for free on arXiv.
