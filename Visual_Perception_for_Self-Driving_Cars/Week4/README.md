# Module 4: 2D Object Detection

The two most prevalent applications of deep neural networks to self-driving are object detection, including pedestrian, cyclists and vehicles, and semantic segmentation, which associates image pixels with useful labels such as sign, light, curb, road, vehicle etc. This module presents baseline techniques for object detection and the following module introduce semantic segmentation, both of which can be used to create a complete self-driving car perception pipeline.

## Learning Objectives

- Define the object detection problem for autonomous driving as an extension of object classification
- Identify quality datasets and their characteristics for training deep network detectors
- Perform basic 2D object detection for a self-driving dataset
- Track a set of moving objects detected by a 2D detector
