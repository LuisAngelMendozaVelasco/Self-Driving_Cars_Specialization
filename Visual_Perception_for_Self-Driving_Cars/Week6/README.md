# Module 6: Putting it together - Perception of dynamic objects in the drivable region

The final module of this course focuses on the implementation of a collision warning system that alerts a self-driving car about the position and category of obstacles present in their lane. The project is comprised of three major segments: 1) Estimating the drivable space in 3D, 2) Semantic Lane Estimation and 3) Filter wrong output from object detection using semantic segmentation.
