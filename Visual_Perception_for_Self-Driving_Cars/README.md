# Visual Perception for Self-Driving Cars

## What you'll learn

- Work with the pinhole camera model, and perform intrinsic and extrinsic camera calibration
- Detect, describe and match image features and design your own convolutional neural networks
- Apply these methods to visual odometry, object detection and tracking
- Apply semantic segmentation for drivable surface estimation
