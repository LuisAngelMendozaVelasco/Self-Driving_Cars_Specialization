# Module 3: Feedforward Neural Networks

Deep learning is a core enabling technology for self-driving perception. This module briefly introduces the core concepts employed in modern convolutional neural networks, with an emphasis on methods that have been proven to be effective for tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Basic network architectures, common components and helpful tools for constructing and training networks are described.

## Learning Objectives

- Perform linear regression to estimate the driving road plane from image data
- Build a basic deep neural network for classification
- Define common loss functions for deep convolutional neural networks
- Use backpropagation to compute the gradient of a loss function with respect to network weights for training
- Train a deep convolutional neural network for an autonomous driving classification task
