# Module 1: Basics of 3D Computer Vision

This module introduces the main concepts from the broad field of computer vision needed to progress through perception methods for self-driving vehicles. The main components include camera models and their calibration, monocular and stereo vision, projective geometry, and convolution operations.

## Learning Objectives

- Build a pinhole camera model and define the model parameters to be found in calibration
- Define the projective geometry required to interpret points in 3D as observed in the image plane
- Formulate the equations and constraints for stereo sensors
- Compute disparity from rectified images
- Understand cross-correlation, convolutions, the difference between them, and what they are used for
