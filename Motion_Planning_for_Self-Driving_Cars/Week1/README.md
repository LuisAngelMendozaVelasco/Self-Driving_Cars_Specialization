# Module 1: The Planning Problem

This module introduces the richness and challenges of the self-driving motion planning problem, demonstrating a working example that will be built toward throughout this course. The focus will be on defining the primary scenarios encountered in driving, types of loss functions and constraints that affect planning, as well as a common decomposition of the planning problem into behaviour and trajectory planning subproblems. This module introduces a generic, hierarchical motion planning optimization formulation that is further expanded and implemented throughout the subsequent modules.

## Learning Objectives

- Explain what the autonomous driving high-level mission entails.
- Recall the set of important basic driving scenarios.
- Develop a set of driving behaviours to handle most basic driving scenarios.
- Recognize important constraints for autonomous driving motion planning.
- Explain the functionality of each step in a hierarchical motion planner.
- List some variants of each step of a hierarchical motion planner.
