# Module 5: Principles of Behaviour Planning

This module develops a basic rule-based behaviour planning system, which performs high level decision making of driving behaviours such as lane changes, passing of parked cars and progress through intersections. The module defines a consistent set of rules that are evaluated to select preferred vehicle behaviours that restrict the set of possible paths and speed profiles to be explored in lower level planning.

## Learning Objectives

- Recall the role of the Behaviour Planner, as well as its inputs and outputs.
- Use state machines to perform behaviour planning, and recognize their advantages and disadvantages.
- Recognize which behaviours are required to handle certain scenarios.
- Understand the advantages and disadvantages of rule engines in behaviour planning.
- Understand the advantages and disadvantages of reinforcement learning in behaviour planning.
