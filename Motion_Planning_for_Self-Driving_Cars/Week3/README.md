# Module 3: Mission Planning in Driving Environments

This module develops the concepts of shortest path search on graphs in order to find a sequence of road segments in a driving map that will navigate a vehicle from a current location to a destination. The modules covers the definition of a roadmap graph with road segments, intersections and travel times, and presents Dijkstraâ€™s and A* search for identification of the shortest path across the road network.

## Learning Objectives

- Recall the mathematical concept of a graph.
- Understand how graphs can be used to represent road networks.
- Apply Breadth First Search (BFS) to an unweighted graph to find the shortest path to a destination.
- Apply Dijkstra's Search to a weighted graph for finding the shortest path in a more realistic road network.
- Apply heuristics through A* Search to improve shortest path search speed.
