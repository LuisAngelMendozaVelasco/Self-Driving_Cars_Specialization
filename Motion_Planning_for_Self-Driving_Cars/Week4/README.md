# Module 4: Dynamic Object Interactions

This module introduces dynamic obstacles into the behaviour planning problem, and presents learners with the tools to assess the time to collision of vehicles and pedestrians in the environment.

## Learning Objectives

- Recall the different types of motion prediction assumptions, and the differences between them.
- Understand how map knowledge can be used for prediction.
- Understand how multi-hypothesis prediction can be used to predict multiple behaviours.
- Compute Time-to-Collision (TTC) through estimation and simulation methods.
