# Module 7: Putting it all together - Smooth Local Planning

Parameterized curves are widely used to define paths through the environment for self-driving. This module introduces continuous curve path optimization as a two point boundary value problem which minimized deviation from a desired path while satisfying curvature constraints.

## Learning Objectives

- Recall the definition of parametric curves, motion planning constraints, and motion planning boundary conditions.
- Understand the differences between spirals and splines, and the tradeoffs of using either.
- Design optimization objectives suited to particular motion planning tasks.
- Use Python libraries to solve optimization problems.
- Implement a conformal lattice planner based on polynomial spiral optimization.
- Compute a velocity profile constrained by curvature, speed limits, and dynamic obstacles.
