# Module 7: Putting it all together

For the last week of the course, now you will get hands on with a simulation of an autonomous vehicle that requires longitudinal and lateral vehicle control design to track a predefined path along a racetrack with a given speed profile. You are encouraged to modify the speed profile and/or path to improve their lap time, without any requirement to do so. Work and play!

## Learning Objectives

- Integrate vehicle modeling and controller design into a complete vehicle control system
- Develop a working simulation with a python-based vehicle autonomy agent
- Tune a control system for tracking performance on a complex path

## Final Project: Self-Driving Vehicle Control
