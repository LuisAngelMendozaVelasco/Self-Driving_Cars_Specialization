# Module 1: The Requirements for Autonomy

Self-driving cars present an extremely rich and inter-disciplinary problem. This module introduces the language and structure of the problem definition, defining the most salient elements of the driving task and the driving environment.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify perception, prediction and planning requirements for driving
- Define the environmental elements that influence driving
- Breakdown the task of driving into elemental decisions and actions
- Assess the effects of driving conditions on the driving task
