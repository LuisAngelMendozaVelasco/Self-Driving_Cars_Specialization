## Supplementary Reading: Safety Assurance for Self-Driving Vehicles

We have a couple of links in this Supplementary Reading discussing various aspects of safety assurance. 

- Here's a link for [NTSB's Report on the 2018 Uber Crash](https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/HAR1903.pdf). 
- Check out Dr. Krzysztof Czarnecki's paper on [WISE Drive: Requirements Analysis Framework for Automated Driving Systems](https://uwaterloo.ca/waterloo-intelligent-systems-engineering-lab/projects/wise-drive-requirements-analysis-framework-automated-driving). You will watch an interview with Dr. Czarnecki's later in this Module. 
- Learn more about the non-mandatory safety guidelines for autonomous cars in the [NHTSA - Automated Driving Systems: A Vision for Safety 2.0](https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/13069a-ads2.0_090617_v9a_tag.pdf) report.
