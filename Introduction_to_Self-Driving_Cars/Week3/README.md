# Module 3: Safety Assurance for Autonomous Vehicles

As the self-driving domain matures, the requirement for safety assurance on public roads become more critical to self-driving developers. You will evaluate the challenges and approaches employed to date to tackle the immense challenge of assuring the safe operation of autonomous vehicles in an uncontrolled public road driving environment.

## Learning Objectives

- Assess the primary contributions to the overall safety system for self-driving cars
- Investigate the main causes of prominent autonomous driving failures recorded to date
- Employ safety assessment methods for analysis of specific scenarios and hazards for self-driving.
- Describe analytical and empirical approaches to safety assessment.
