# Module 6: Vehicle Lateral Control

This week, you will learn about how lateral vehicle control ensures that a fixed path through the environment is tracked accurately. You will see how to define geometry of the path following control problem and develop both a simple geometric control and a dynamic model predictive control approach.

## Learning Objectives

- Define the geometry of the lateral control problem, including heading and cross track errors
- Design a geometric steering controller to track a straight line segment
- Identify the limits of geometric controllers as wheel slip increases
- Explore options for dynamic control, including model predictive control
